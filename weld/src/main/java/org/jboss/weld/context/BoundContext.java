 * added or removed) however changes will not be written through to the
 * underlying data store.

 * Normally, a detachable context will have it's underlying bean store attached
 * on a call to {@link ManagedContext#activate()} and detached on a call to
 * {@link ManagedContext#deactivate()} however a subtype of {@link BoundContext}
 * may change this behavior.
